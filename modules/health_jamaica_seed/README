# health_jamaica_seed Module

A Simple module that contains only data to be imported.  

This module should always be installed last - after health_jamaica_profile has
had a chance to complete and, if a sync-master instance, ICD10 has been
installed as well.

Some goals of this module are:

  * to be designed so it is usable on all Jamaica instances
  * to only contain data, and import/export utilities - only for local data
  * currently only contains access_rights.xml - Groups + Permissions
  * Need to include : 
    * The simple stuff - parishes, regions, sectors, areas
    * Institutions - Hospitals and Health Centers
    * Specialties - for both types of institutions
    * Main-Specialty mapping for Hospitals.
