Country Jamaica (module)
========================

This module contains some basic functionality that makes Tryton usable in
Jamaica. Primarily, this module : 

1. Merges Kingston and St. Andrew into a single parish with ID 1 and as a 
   result, there is no Saint Andrew parish.
2. includes all the post offices in the country with associated communities
3. includes a language en_JM or English (Jamaica) that uses ISO date among
   other things.
