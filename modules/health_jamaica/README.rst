Jamaica ePAS is built on top of GNU Health and Tryton.

GNU HEALTH is a free, centralized Health and Hospital Information System that provides the following functionality :

* Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
* Hospital Information System (HIS)
* Health Information System

We took GNU Health as a core and made many improvements to the process
flow and user interfaces to make it suitable for daily use in health 
care provision centres across the island (primary care and hospitals).
